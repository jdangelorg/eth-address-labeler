Hey!

This is a Chrome extension that changes the html of every webpage you visit. You'll have a database of saved ETH addresses that will automatically be replaced with the name of the person/entity you saved it as; This makes trading/analysis easier when you can possibly see that an address belongs to someone you already know about. (a whale, a bot, or otherwise important information that could help you in your trading)
